<h3> 🧔🏻‍♂️ About me!</h3>

Welcome to my profile! I'm Joaquín Castaños, I'm 24 years old and I perceive myself as a very proactive, motivated, analytical, social person with a constant desire to learn and improve myself constantly.

I'm currently living in Marseille 📍, France 🇫🇷, where I'm pursuing a double degree to obtain my Engineering Diplomas at École Centrale de Marseille (ECM) and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC). Additionally, I've a BSc. Eng. at PUC, where I specialised in computer science, information systems and industrial engineering.

Throughout my university career, I've participated in different spaces where I was able to develop, in parallel to my academic knowledge, soft skills, socioemotional skills and live unforgettable experiences. I've been an entrepreneur, a volunteer firefighter, a political representative, a teaching and research assistant, and above all, a very curious and aware student.

I'm passionate about data science and information technologies, and in the future I would like to focus my career on digital transformation, to bridge social gaps and contribute to the development of my region (Latin America), and why not, the whole world.
